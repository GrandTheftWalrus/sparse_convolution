# Notes

Toeplitz matrices have a couple properties that make them a useful intermediary for performing convolution efficiently
- The convolution of an array x with a kernel h can be represented by the matrix multiplication T * x, where T is a Toeplitz matrix whose repeated column is h.
- Circulant toeplitz matrices can be "diagonalized" by a Fast Fourier Transform (which is fast to do). A property of diagonals is that a function (such as matrix multiplication) can be performed on the diagonal of a matrix instead of the matrix itself to get the same result, but it's much faster because you need to muck with way less elements.
